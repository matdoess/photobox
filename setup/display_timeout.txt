Tried Foggy's way, and it did not work for me.
I found another solution elsewhere in these forums and it works for me:

sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

In that file, look for:
[SeatDefault]

and insert this line:
xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

My test monitor has been on for a couple of days now  :-)
